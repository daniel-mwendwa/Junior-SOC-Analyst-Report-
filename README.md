## Introduction  
This report is part of my **SOC Analyst training** and documents my experience with the **Junior SOC Analyst Intro** module on TryHackMe. It outlines the key responsibilities of each SOC tier and demonstrates practical applications using security monitoring tools.  

## SOC Structure  
A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is responsible for **monitoring, detecting, investigating, and responding** to cybersecurity threats. It is divided into three tiers:  

### **Tier 1: Triage Analysts**  
- First line of defense, monitoring security alerts  
- Performs initial triage and escalates critical incidents  
- Analyzes suspicious activities using SIEM tools  

### **Tier 2: Incident Responders**  
- Investigates escalated incidents and determines root causes  
- Contains, mitigates, and eradicates security threats  
- Documents response actions for future reference  

### **Tier 3: Threat Hunters**  
- Proactively hunts for advanced threats  
- Conducts malware analysis and integrates threat intelligence  
- Enhances security monitoring strategies  

## Hands-on Experience  
This module involved using **security monitoring tools** to analyze alerts and respond to incidents. Key tasks included:  
- Identifying unauthorized connection attempts  
- Escalating incidents to Tier 2 analysts  
- Blocking malicious IP addresses  



## Conclusion  
Completing this module provided valuable insights into SOC operations and security analysis. As I continue my **cybersecurity journey**, I aim to apply this knowledge to real-world security monitoring and incident response scenarios.
